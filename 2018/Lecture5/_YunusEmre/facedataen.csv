Data,Angry
I was guessing something like this was not done already,0
I thought you did not do this for your good and you use it against us.,1
it is unfair for companies to sell this data for bad business.,1
There Was No Problem For Me,0
I do not use facebook,0
It's creepy to learn that Facebook sells our information even though it's psychological manipulation capacity.,1
I do not use Facebook. but every member is using our site information,0
I do not care because I already know that all social media and applications are done in secret.,0
I was already suspicious of such a possibility. it did not affect me. I still do not find ethics.,1
I'm not surprised,1
Obviously there was not much problem bigger,0
I think my information is worthless,0
Sad situation I already knew,1
what do they do with my knowledge that I do not need such jobs,1
I wondered who sold ours for the real ones. Because the goal can not be simple people like us.,1
I was surprised that you thought you had already served many times before,0
nothing. I do not care. if an application is free. you are the ones that are sold.,0
I was very natural. Because you have about 2.1 billion people in your hand and this information can easily be converted into money.,0
I'm angry,1
There is no remedy for what you think.,0
I did not know,0
I do not think that facebook or any other site uses information,0
Good thing,0
We are in dire need of private life. but we also need services like Facebook and its Whatsapp. Instagram.,1
They are already talking and putting my google dials in my eye.,1
I'm not using Facebook,1
there is money on the tip of the job. the priorities of the men who value it. unfortunately there is nothing to do,1
It is already certain that such a thing will happen,1
I was very angry with Facebook and I would close my account but I did not close it because I needed to contact some people.,1
I could get at least an extra discount for my information,1
I already knew. I did not get into any thoughts,0
I already knew,0
I could do the same,0
nothing,0
nothing,0
nothing,0
they can sell,0
We have known for years. according to the pages you like and they are making good ads as well. I see interesting content at least,0
nothing,0
Business is over now,0
nothing,0
I'm crazy,1
I do not have any data in the social media that I am not very impressed with.,0
Obviously I did not care too much because I did not have a lot of private information,0
nothing,0
Not a problem for me,0
My trust in the site has diminished and I have deleted my personal photos and situations,1
I did not ask too much for not using it often.,0
I already knew they were going to do things like that but since facebook does not have much of a thing,1
I already knew,0
I was safe. I did not wait,1
nothing,0
nothing,0
I thought it was a lie. but then I was not too interested in my beliefs,0
nothing,0
I did not think of anything to grow. but every application that is free of charge is doing it.,1
Obviously I have to get facebook from the phone,0
it was not in vain because that satma was the practice of other applications,0
I got angry at something I know,1
nothing,0
I was right again,1
We are safe,0
I did not care much for thinking this was done by most implementers,0
Without my permission I was very angry with me. I will not rely on any social media program for doing such a thing,1
Bad,1
It does this in other applications like WhatsApp. I'm mad at them,0
I'm not surprised. I think other platforms are doing it.,0
Not the only one,1
